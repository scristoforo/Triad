  <h2>Welcome to the Archetype Assessment</h2>
  <p>
    Every man is called to <strong>provide</strong>, <strong>protect</strong>, and <strong>preside</strong>. These timeless responsibilities are personified in three foundational archetypes. Within each man, all three are present — but in different proportions, and at different stages of development.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>💼 The Merchant</strong> – <em>The Provider</em><br/>
      The Merchant masters the world of value — building systems, generating resources, and ensuring nothing vital is lacking. He provides stability through strategy, structure, and foresight. He understands the economy of life — whether financial, relational, or spiritual — and leverages it for growth, not greed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>🗡️ The Warrior</strong> – <em>The Protector</em><br/>
      The Warrior faces adversity with discipline, strength, and resolve. He secures life by standing between danger and the innocent — not just physically, but morally. Trained for hardship, anchored in courage, and fueled by duty, the Warrior defends boundaries both seen and unseen.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>👑 The Noble</strong> – <em>The Presider</em><br/>
      The Noble governs with wisdom, presence, and moral clarity. He presides not through force but through inner authority — discerning what is just, navigating conflict with grace, and guiding others from principle rather than ego. The Noble dignifies life through leadership rooted in character.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This 30-question assessment will help you measure your current strengths across these three archetypes. Each archetype contains ten essential skills — practical, embodied traits that determine how you provide, protect, and preside in real life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Answer honestly. There are no wrong answers — only truth and clarity. The purpose is not to label you, but to illuminate your strengths and expose areas for growth.
